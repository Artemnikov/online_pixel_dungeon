This project is a simple pixel dungeon like online game (real time) that allows 2 or more users to connect and play.

So the original pixel dungeon is a action based game, its not built for multi player.
but this game will be fully real time, and will not rely on players taking action, it will be fully autonimus.

The stack:
front-end: Reach
back-end: Fastapi

The game must have 50 floors, each 5 floors would include a boss.
The game should have all the minions and same maps as the original Shattered pixel dungeon:
